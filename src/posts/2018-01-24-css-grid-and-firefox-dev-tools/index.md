My feelings on the new(ish) layout tools we have in CSS can be expressed in one tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The more I use Flexbox and CSS Grid the more impressed I am with how little code I have to write to layout a webpage</p>&mdash; Jeremy Law (@LawJeremy) <a href="https://twitter.com/LawJeremy/status/937529014448771072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

I say newish because while Grid is just starting to gain some traction on the web, Flexbox has been around for a while now. And although it still requires vendor prefixes here and there, its works in all modern browsers.

I happened to be working on a new layout for my website (has it been a month already?) so I decided to dive into Grid and see what all the hype is about.
